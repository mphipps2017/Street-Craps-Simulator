# Street-Craps-Simulator
Simulates the game of Street Craps to give the user information on what a players probability of winning is, based on if he or she goes first.

Rules:
In the game of Street Craps the players flip a coin to see who goes first.  During a players turn you roll the dice.
Should the dice land on specific numbers certain events will trigger.  If the die rolls on a 7 or 11 the player is
said to have the winning roll and must give the dice to the other player.  Should the other player not roll a 7 or 11
they lose.  If the dice are rolled with a 2 it is an automatic loss. Finally if the player rolls a 12 they
may re-roll the dice.

Results:
The winner of the coin flipper (If they go first) wins roughly 50% of the time.
